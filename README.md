# The Workouter App 

## Technologies used
For this app I used Flutter, Dart, Firebase, Android Studio & Emulator, & Tears

Flutter is an Open-Source UI SDK developed by Google. It allows the development of iOS/Android apps and uses Dart as the programming language. Personally, it seems pretty similar to React and it seems to be set up as an object-oriented programming language - which was new to me, so I didn't always adhere to it. I wanted to try a completely new set of technologies, and since I was trying Flutter & Dart for the first time, I made the backend easier by using Firebase.

### Features
1 User Authentication with Registration/Login/Logout
2 Reset/Forget Password
3 CRUD of Exercises.
4 Timer & Counter to keep track of your workout
5 Simple Profile page

### Improvements
1 Stricter Validation
2 Improve overall look and feel
3 Make functionalities work with each other (start workouts and preload them onto the counter)
4 Social function to share workout done on feed
5 Use profile page to display more meaningful information

### Challenges
Make a lot mistakes initially where I tried to first do this with React Native, building pages for the first 2 weeks, whilst trying to figure out how to get the Android Emulator working - and unfortunately it cannot seem to work on WSL2, which made me make the switch to Flutter.
